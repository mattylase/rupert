[Rupert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxwFaH7l53Y) is a Discord bot that wants you to ready up. He specializes in quickly getting the attention of everyone in your current voice channel, so they know to let everyone know that they're done peeing or getting a beer or putting the dog out or receiving a pizza or whatever.

## Building Rupert

## Running Rupert
Rupert can be run from the command line as `java -jar Rupert-1.0.jar`. Rupert will expect your bot's token to be in a file called `token.rupert` in the same directory that the jar resides in.

## Using Rupert
Rupert will listen on every text channel for people waiting to **R**eady **Up** can be activated by either the `/rup` or `/rupert` commands. He is at his best when you are in a voice channel with some friends, but will do his best to help you out even when you're alone.
